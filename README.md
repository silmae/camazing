Easy-to-use machine vision library for GenICam-compliant cameras

## Special thanks

The outcome of this project would not be possible without the efforts of
Kazunari Kudo @kazunarikudo, who wrote the GenICam Python bindings, and helped
us with the initial problems we faced when installing a GenTL Producer and
Harvester.
