# Acknowledgements

The original development at the University of Jyväskylä was funded by the
Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (TEKES) (grant 1711/31/2016).

## Special thanks

This project would not be possible without the efforts of
Kazunari Kudo @kazunarikudo, who wrote the GenICam Python bindings, and helped
us with the initial problems we faced when installing a GenTL Producer and
Harvester.
